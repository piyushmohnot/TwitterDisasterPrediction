## Competition Description
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster. The author explicitly uses the word “ABLAZE” but means it metaphorically. This is clear 
to a human right away, especially with the visual aid. But it’s less clear to a machine.

In this competition, the challenge is to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.
